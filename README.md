# digital-signal-quantization-coding
This repository contains MATLAB functions and scripts for quantizing and encoding a sampled signal, as part of a communication systems laboratory exercise. The project demonstrates mid-rise/mid-tread quantization, natural binary encoding, and visualization of results for different quantization levels.

## Files Overview

### 1. `quantizer.m`
**Function**: `[d, y, e] = quantizer(x, L)`  
**Description**: Quantizes a sampled signal `x` into `L` levels.  
- **Inputs**:
  - `x`: Input signal vector.
  - `L`: Number of quantization levels (even: mid-rise, odd: mid-tread).
- **Outputs**:
  - `d`: Quantization step size.
  - `y`: Quantized signal.
  - `e`: Quantization error (`y - x`).

### 2. `coder.m`
**Function**: `z = coder(y, d)`  
**Description**: Encodes the quantized signal `y` into natural binary code.  
- **Inputs**:
  - `y`: Quantized signal.
  - `d`: Quantization step size.
- **Output**:
  - `z`: Binary-encoded signal (as a character array of binary strings).

### 3. `script.m`
**Script**: Generates plots for quantization and error signals.  
- **Steps**:
  1. Samples the signal `x(t) = 4cos(2πt)` with `Ts = 0.01` over `t ∈ [0, 1]`.
  2. Quantizes and encodes the signal for `L = 7` (mid-tread) and `L = 8` (mid-rise).
  3. Plots:
     - Original signal.
     - Quantized signals and quantization errors for both `L = 7` and `L = 8`.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   ```matlab
   script
This generates a figure with subplots comparing quantization results for L = 7 and L = 8.

Example Output:

Top Row: Original signal x(t).

Middle Row: Quantized signal y(t) and error q(t) for L = 7.

Bottom Row: Quantized signal y(t) and error q(t) for L = 8.

Key Results
Quantization Step d:

Smaller d for higher L, leading to reduced quantization error.

Error Comparison:

For L = 7 (mid-tread), errors are symmetric around zero.

For L = 8 (mid-rise), errors range between ±d/2.

Dependencies
MATLAB R2016a or later.

No additional toolboxes required.

Note: The plots generated by script.m highlight the trade-off between quantization levels and error magnitude. Higher L (more levels) reduces error but increases encoding complexity.
